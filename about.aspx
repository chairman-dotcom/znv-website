(hereinafter “the Group” or “the Company”) was established in 1984. After 30 years of development, it has become a leading city and town developer and service provider in China. The Group focuses on the three most vibrant economic circles nationwide and key cities in Midwest China. The Group first appeared in the Fortune Global 500 list in 2016, ranking 356th. It has since remained on the league table for four consecutive years, ranking 307th, 332nd, 254th and 208th respectively.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">In 2014, Vanke had expanded its positioning as a company offering “good houses, good services, good community” to an “integrated city service provider”. In 2018, the Group further upgraded such positioning to “city and town developer and service provider” and specified it as four roles: to provide setting to a beautiful life, to contribute to the economy, to explore creative experimental fields and to construct a harmonious ecosystem.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">In 2017, Shenzhen Metro Group Co., Ltd. (SZMC) became the largest shareholder of the Group. SZMC keenly supports Vanke’s mixed ownership structure, its integrated city ancillary service provider strategy and the business partner mechanism, and also supports the operation and management work undertaken by Vanke’s management team in accordance with pre-determined strategic objective as well as the deepening of the “Railway + Property” development model.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">Vanke has been persistently providing good products and good services to the general public, satisfying people’s various demands for a good life with its best efforts. Up till now, the ecosystem it has been constructing is getting into shape. In the property area, Vanke has always upheld the vision of “building quality housing for ordinary people to live in”. While consolidating its existing advantages of residential property development and property service, the Group’s businesses have been expanded to areas such as commercial development, rental housing, logistics and warehousing services, ski resorts, and education. This has laid a solid foundation for the Group to better satisfy people’s needs for a good life and to achieve sustainable development. In the future, with “people’s needs for a good life” as the core and cash flow as the basis, the Group would continue to “follow the fundamental rules of the world and strive for the best as a team” while executing the strategy of “city and town developer and service provider”. The Group would constantly create more true value and strive to be a respectable enterprise in this great new era.</p><p><img src="/web/20240920220351im_/https://cnold.vanke.com/en/upload/img/2015-11-13/0da1ef9e-73b0-42a9-bdb5-871483b7d555.jpg" style="float:none;width:785px;height:270px;" width="785" height="270" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"/></p><div class="hidden"><p style="font-size:14px;">In 2019, the Group achieved a revenue of RMB367.89 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 23.6%; and the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company reached RMB38.87 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 15.1%.

In 2017, the Group explored and came up with the theoretical base, core mechanism and basic guideline that inform Vanke’s business partnership model through collaborative work of the teams, and at the same time, it has actively started the practical execution of the business partner model.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">While achieving growth in performance, the Group also responded positively to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council in succeeding poverty alleviation. Using its own advantages, the Group has been supporting public affairs and carried out charity activities in areas of poverty alleviation, education development, children’s healthcare, disaster relief, community development, garbage classification, climate conference, and ecological protection, etc., striving to be a good “corporate citizen”. </p><p style="font-size:14px;">Vanke Charity Foundation was officially founded in 2008, approved by China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs. From 2018 to June 2020, the Foundation has put in RMB 644 million on poverty alleviation. The Group and Shenzhen Municipal Government jointly endowed the Tibet Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum and officially delivered the project in June 2018. Vanke endowed and constructed the Tuheman School in Xinjiang and delivered the project in September 2016, which did not get any damage from the earthquake in the county in 2017, and guaranteed the safety of the teachers and students. Vanke endowed and delivered the first phase buildings of the Shouning East District Middle School in Fujian Province, which include facilities of teaching buildings, comprehensive buildings, labs, and sports ground, providing good learning environment and advanced hardware facilities for more children. In Zundao of Sichuan Province, Vanke has been persistently supporting the education development of the Sundao School for ten years now. In the past ten years, students’ performance in the high school entrance exams has constantly improved and over a hundred graduates have entered university. In addition, Vanke donated to and supported the basic education of five counties in Guizhou and Gansu, to improve the facilities in kindergartens and primary school in poor countryside. Apart from that, Vanke Charity Foundation collaborated with the Beijing Lead Foundation to support the “Teach for China” program and recruit good teachers for the countryside. It has also worked with the Green and Shine Foundation to recruit teachers to improve the basic education environment and education level of the countryside schools in Zhenfeng County of Guizhou Province.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">As the city and town developer and service provider, responding to the arrangement by the Guangdong Provincial Government for the city of Shenzhen to support the development of Heyuan and Shanwei cities, Vanke has started village revitalization work in these two cities. It aims to improve the outlook of villages, promote the Red Culture, and perfect the basic infrastructure, as well as to heighten the village’s cultural and hygienic level, and encourage young villagers to return to hometown to start businesses and improve the well-off of villagers.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">For many years, Vanke has joined hands with all walks of life, and carried out specific salvation and support programs to help children grow up healthily and happily. Vanke has been actively following climate change and exercising its green responsibility. Since 2009, Vanke has participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference for many years and hosted the China Pavilion Enterprise Conference in order to promote international cooperation and communication on climate change. Furthermore, Vanke has been vigorously promoting public welfare projects like garbage classification, wetland conservation, biodiversity conservation and protection of historical buildings.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">In the area of environmental protection and sustainable development, Vanke designed, constructed and operated the Vanke Botanic Pavilion, which is one of the four core venues of International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing. The theme of the pavilion is “Incredible Wisdom of Plants” and it uses “the rising horizon” as its architectural design concept. There are over 1000 species of plants in the Pavilion, showcasing the wisdom of plant evolution.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">Looking ahead, the Group would continue to “follow the fundamental rules of the world and strive for the best as a team” while executing the strategy of being “a city and town developer and service provider”. It would insist on the idea of striving for the best together to meet people’s increasing demand for a better life, to constantly create more true value and realize quality development.</p><p style="font-size:14px;">Honors and rewards:</p><p style="font-size:14px;">In 1991, Vanke became the second listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and has earned wide recognition from investors through its constantly growing performance as well as its standardized and transparent corporate governance structure.
